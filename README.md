# Singly Linked List
This repository contains the code from practicing singly linked list implementation in C++. 

To organize the code:
* `main_SLL.cpp` : contains the main function, runs the code.
* `singlyLL.cpp` : contains the implementation of constructors and functions.
* `singlyLL.h  ` : header file, contains class and function declarations.


  > Additionally,
  * `singlyLL_wComments.cpp` : declaration and implementation in the same file; contains my personal comments to break down the code.
